Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I've been meaning to start writing for a while now. There's something valuable about explaining things — it forces you to understand them deeply. Plus, I've learned so much from other developers' blogs that it feels right to contribute back.

## What to Expect

This blog will primarily cover:

- **Technical deep dives** — exploring how things work under the hood
- **Tutorials** — step-by-step guides on tools and technologies I use
- **Thoughts on development** — lessons learned, workflow improvements, opinions

I'm not aiming for a strict publishing schedule. I'd rather write when I have something worthwhile to share than force content out weekly.

## The Stack

This site itself is an interesting project. It's built with:

- **Hugo** — a static site generator written in Go
- **Cloudflare Pages** — for hosting and automatic deployments
- **GitHub** — where the source lives

The whole workflow is: write markdown, push to GitHub, and the site updates automatically. Simple, fast, and no servers to maintain.

## Code Example

Since this is a developer blog, here's the obligatory code block:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Syntax highlighting works out of the box with Hugo. Pretty nice.

## What's Next

I have a few posts in draft already — topics ranging from CLI tools to system design concepts. Stay tuned.

If you want to follow along, there's an [RSS feed](/index.xml) you can subscribe to.

Thanks for reading. Let's build something interesting.
