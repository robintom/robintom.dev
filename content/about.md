I'm Robin Tom, a developer who enjoys building things that work well.

I'm particularly interested in systems programming, web development, and understanding how things work under the hood. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably reading about it or exploring new technologies.

This blog is where I share what I learn — deep dives into interesting problems, tutorials, and occasional thoughts on the craft of software development.

## What I Work With

Primarily working with languages and tools that let me build reliable, performant software. Always learning something new.

## Get in Touch

The best way to reach me is via [GitHub](https://github.com/robintom) or email.
